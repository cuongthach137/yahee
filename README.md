# Yahee key features:



Chat 1vs1 - Users can:
1. Exchange texts, media (photos, voice recordings), click and hold send button to send a default emoji of different sizes aligned with how long the button is pressed (similar behavior to what you have on facebook messenger)
2. Pin, reply, hide, recall, copy, forward or react to messages
3. Set nicknames, conversation theme or block the other end
4. Buzz others (their chat windows will shake) when sending a default emoji or when the sent text contains certain words.
5. Video call (within local network online, for now)

Group chat
1. Most of the above
2. Set conversation theme and its name.
3. Add more members
4. Become the admin of the conversation (conversation creator is the admin by default). As an admin, you can:
4.1 Make another (member) admin
4.2 Remove another or yourself as admin
4.3 Remove a member from the group
4.4 Remove and block a member (Once done you and others shouldn't be able to add him back)
* In the event the conversation doesn't have an admin, you are given the option to claim as the admin
5. Leave the conversation

Users can also customize their experience by
1. Uploading their own profile photo, turning off notification sounds, setting chat window theme, search for contacts
2. Sending a new message to a person or several people (creating a new conversation if there isn't one in place)

Other features:
1. Messages go through several stages as shown in their status before they are seen: uploading (sending to the server), sent (saved to database, but recipients have gone offline), delivered (the message is delivered but has yet to be seen by recipients), seen (message is seen by recipients),  failed (the message is not saved to database)
2. Infinite scrolling: initially the server will send back 30 messages or less for each conversation. User can scroll up to see previous messages
